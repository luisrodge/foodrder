# About the foorder.bz platform

foodrder.bz is a restaurant & food platform that makes it crazy easy to find and order something to eat and drink from a catalog of local restaurants. Restaurants can list
their various menus and foods/drinks. Customers can browse through a collection of local restaurants & foods and easily add foods/drinks to their cart. foodrder.bz 
provides an ordering system that enables customers to very easily order food from across multiple restaurants all in one go! It's versatility allows people to customize 
their orders by opting for delivery, food variants, and food additions. foodrder.bz takes advantage of an external sms gateway which allows restaurants to opt for receiving 
new order details realtime via text message. Customers that opt for pickup will semi-automatically receive a text message informing them that their order is fully ready for
pickup.
